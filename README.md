# Face Shield
The goal of this project is to create a low cost, high quality, reusable face
shield that can be quickly deployed.

This face shield is based on a design by Mike Doell (@mike_doell), recreated in FreeCAD and further adapted by Jake Bender with help from Glia's team of collaborators, designers, and testers, as well as engineering and design input from [Mosaic Manufacturing](https://www.mosaicmfg.com).

The existing face shield by @mike_doell is currently being sold at [Glia's online store](https://store.glia.org). The FreeCAD version is currently undergoing design changes and improvements, and is **not** currently being publicly distributed.

To purchase the existing version, go to the [Glia Store](https://store.glia.org).

# Bill of Materials
## Printed parts
* 1 head piece (FCheadpiece.stl)

## Other hardware
* 60cm x 1cm elastic strap
* Large: 28cm x 25cm x 0.125mm (5mil or greater) clear plastic sheet such as Mylar (facesheet-large.svg)
* Small (default): 28cm x 23cm x 0.125mm (5mil or greater) clear plastic sheet such as Mylar (facesheet-small.svg)

# Print instructions
* Use PETG or ABS
* Layer height: 0.3mm
* Use PrusaSlicer 2.2 or above to import 3MF file
* Modify filament and printer settings as needed.
* **DO NOT MODIFY PRINT SETTINGS**
* Export and print

<!--As on this commit, I have not created 3MF files for the FreeCAD faceshield. This is on my to-do for the next commit.-->

# Mylar sheet Instructions
* Cut the mylar sheet with a laser cutter or die cutting machine if available.
* If a cutter is not available, you may manually cut the sheets to
28cm x 25cm. Consider rounding corners as per template

# Decontamination
* Disassemble head piece from strap and mylar sheet
* Soak entire shield and strap for 1 minute in warm bleach solution in well-ventilated area
* Rinse with water
* Hang to dry

# Assembly instructions
* See [Assembly Instructions illustration](instructions.jpg) for a visual guide (NEEDS TO BE UPDATED FOR FREECAD VERSION)
* Insert strap into printed head piece
* Loop strap through buckle and attach to self using heat or a dab of glue
* Insert clear plastic sheet, using strap to hold mylar in place.
